# What is Home Headquarters?
**Home Headquarters** is a revival group for the now defunct game PlayStation Home.

Over the recent years they've become more and more popular, throughout various methods of advertising themselves.

Unfortunately, they've done a decent job at hiding their real face and not many people know the real behaviour of the people who lead the group.

This document aims to put an end to that, once and for all.

> Needless to say, this document has been written from the perspective of the Destination Home team and, most importantly, the author of it: `zeph`.
