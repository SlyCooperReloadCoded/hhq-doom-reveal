# Mediation attempts
Over time, multiple attempts at obtaining some form of reconciliation or collaboration were made, plenty of them started by Home Headquarters themselves.

*Every single one of them has failed.*

### History of attempts
1. Immediately after `Splicewave` was kicked from the Destination Home team
2. `Home Laboriatories`’s birth
3. The private group chat between me (`zeph`), `Knight` and `AgentDark447`
4. `ShittyJesus`’s *“PEACE BETWEEN HOMES”* group chat
5. `SkeletonKey` contacting `Figment`
6. `Doobs` becoming an unbiased mediator between the two groups’ leadership.

In every instance, it failed because these their team has lied, did not act in good faith, twisted words, manipulated or were not at all interested in anything remotely reasonable *(e.g. making ridiculous demands and shifting blame onto Destination Home without taking any — or completely downplaying — their role in various things)*.

### Chapter 6: Doobs' Efforts as an Unbiased Mediator

Hey all, the change in tone that you might've noticed is because I, **Doobs**, will assume the first person for this last section discussing my own attempts to rejoin Destination Home and Home Headquarters. Before I begin, I want to express a sentiment I shared with Splicewave in Direct Messages on one of the last times I've spoken to him - August 20, 2024. This message was: 

*"When I went into this project, I went in with a genuine desire to make Home and leave Home better than I found it... I can't see myself working in any Playstation Home project, whether DH or HHQ or any that come in the future, if all I'm going to be is miserable"*

This sentiment came after it was made known that one of their members leaked sensitive messages. Of course, this isn't the focus of this section, but this is the sentiment that I approached any further correspondences with HHQ and its prominent members and leadership.

#### 6.1. Starting the Mitigation Server

Confident in my abilities regarding leadership and conflict resolution, I did what I have done before in spaces that I've led - establish a space prepared for those needing to discuss anything with a non-biased mediator. On August 17, 2024, I created the server with the intention of finding some form of common ground between the two factions. In the server, anyone who was from either side was restricted from speaking but could read the chat. Those who had the privilege to speak—which was agreed upon by all parties—were assigned a role according to the server they were a part of—either @DH or @HHQ, and were given the privilege to speak.

Before any discussions began, those present also were required to agree and adhere to a set of rules that I wrote, which were as follows:

```
# DMZ Rules:
- Neutral Ground: The DMZ is a neutral space. Leaders (or selected representatives) from both groups must respect this and refrain from any personal attacks, inflammatory language, or provocations.
- Mediation Role: The mediator, <@111672212972404736> (Myself), is the only individual allowed to intervene. Their role is to facilitate the conversation by ensuring fair and respectful communication. They will not take sides or offer opinions on the conflict. 
- Right to mediation: Both sides have the right to call for a mediator for any reason. At that point, all discussion should cease **immediately** until the mediator has resolved the conflict. The mediator also reserves the right to call for mediation at any point. When mediation occurs, the speaker role from all parties will be removed until a resolution has been proposed and accepted. 
- Respectful Communication: All discussions must be conducted respectfully. Any breaches, such as insults, yelling (e.g., ALL CAPS), or passive-aggressive comments, will result in intervention by the mediator.
- Stay on Topic: Discussions should remain focused on resolving the specific issues at hand. Attempts to derail the conversation or bring up unrelated past grievances are not permitted.
- No Escalation Outside the DMZ: Conversations, arguments, or negative sentiments should not be taken back to other servers. The goal is resolution, not perpetuation.
- Confidentiality: All discussions within the DMZ are confidential. Sharing details with anyone outside the designated participants is strictly prohibited.
## Resolution Focused: The purpose of the DMZ is to work towards a resolution. All participants must enter with a willingness to find common ground and compromise where necessary. All participants must also enter with a willingness to set aside negative sentiments about either community and its members and staff, both within this DMZ and externally.
```

#### 6.2 The Speakers Involved in the Mitigation Server

When I started the mitigation server, the initial members were meant to be **Splicewave** speaking on behalf of Home Headquarters, and **Knight** speaking on behalf of Destination Home. As previously warned by Knight about the other attempts at mediation—which have been discussed in this chapter—he declined, stating that it was not a worthy investment of his time. I also had thought to invite another member, **ToyKyle**, but I really wanted to keep him away from the dramatics, as this is something he's wanted to refrain from. Pressed, I stated to **Splicewave** that ToyKyle was not interested, and never invited ToyKyle, even though I told Splicewave I did. Thus, remained **Zeph**, who agreed to speaking on behalf of Destination Home. **Splicewave** agreed to speak on behalf of Home Headquarters; however, as one of the interests arose on the side of Home Headquarters for a cross-server event, **Marion**/**Maripari**—the originator for the idea, was selected as speaker for Home Headquarters, while **Zeph** remained the speaker for Destination Home. During this time, I—**Doobs**—remained neutral, only operating as someone to step in if any of the agreed-upon rules were broken, and without an agenda for neither Destination Home nor Home Headquarters.

#### 6.3 The Discussions in the Mitigation Server

The first, and really only, discussion in the mitigation server was a cross-server event between Home Headquarters and Destination Home. Before beginning the discussion, I emphasized on the importance of agreeing and adhering to the rules I had set. After **Marion** agreed to the rules, discussions began. In the early parts of the chat, seems to be productive—and promising—discourse. Both **Marion** and **Zeph** are exchanging information and brainstorming ideas; for instance, discussions around cross-server events and what they could entail. There's a willingness to compromise and find common ground, as indicated by **Marion's** comment about wanting to help each other and create a good relationship between the servers, which ultimately fulfills the purpose of this server.

#### 6.4 The Need for Mediation

As the conversation progressed, it became less productive due to escalating tensions involving loyalty amidst Destination Home staff members. The discussions turned into arguments when topics such as server loyalty, event intentions, and perceived ulterior motives were brought up. An attempt at an exchange was made where, at the time, a cross-server event would be hosted so long as the name of the individual leaking screenshots and other data was given to **Zeph**.

Around a similar time, Destination Home was in the process of onboarding a new—and controversial—member to the Guide team. Upon this realization, **Marion** took to a friend server in which I was a member of to discuss the decision. The comments about Destination Home directly contradicted with the behavior I expected as someone wanting to create the cross event. Some comments included:

```
Just saw they made PolarJC a staff in DH
dh is really retarded ngl
```

Upon this realization, I not only clarified this decision but also stated my disappointment in this sort of behavior, that **I'm not sure I appreciate this attitutde if you're speaking on behalf of HHQ at the DH-HHQ DMZ server**. As this was met with resistance and an eventual removal from this server, I called for mediation.

#### 6.5 Splicewave Shoots His Peacemaker by Lying About His Informant

Tensions only further escalated when the news of this controversial guide made its way to other Home revival projects, namely Home Laboratory.

His message: **And from what doobs has shown me, several of the guides are not happy with joiningcard being a guide**

At no point, aside from in the Mediation server in which I've shown images of Marion's comments about DH, did I share information about the disapproval about the controversial Guide. In addition, the general sentiment was perpetuated into my own direct messages.

#### 6.6 Toro's Removal as Lead Moderator

The final strike was the removal of **Toro** as Lead Moderator in Destination Home. After **Marion's** departure from Staff in March of 2024, **Toro's** messages inside and outside of Destination Home painted a clear image that their heart was not in the project anymore. For some time, they complained about the lack of progress and inactivity within the team—which was understood but still did not justify messaging **Marion** about the various things about staff chats or the feint cache reviewer request that was clearly not an actual investment.

A message from **Knight** reads to **Toro**:

```
Toro, I've removed your Staff roles.

Your messages, both in and out of DH, clearly tell me that your heart is not in the project anymore—particularly since Marion's removal from Staff. I get you're frustrated with the lack of progress and inactivity within the team too, but that doesn't justify messaging Marion about the various things in the staff chats or the feint cache reviewer request that we both know you weren't actually interested in. At this point, it seems you might be holding onto Staff roles for unclear reasons, but it's obviously not out of the passion you used to have.

Obviously, with that said, you deserve the Contributor role and I'll also be giving you a new 'ex-Staff' role too since I don't want to downplay the contributions you did make. But that's not in contradiction to the fact that we both know you don't want to be Staff anymore and you're actively working with Marion against DH. I hope you understand.
```

Shortly after this message was sent, **Toro** sends a message publicly:

```
Goodbye everyone, it seems my roles here have been removed for no reason.
You won't see me here anymore and it's because DH Staff has a big ego.
They recruited someone whoadvertized other Home servers 2 weeks ago but decided to remove my roles.
How ironic.
Thanks to those who were always so lovely to me. You know who you are. Byebye ♥️ 
#NotMyPlayStationHome
```

Not one minute after this message is sent, they join as a moderator at Home Headquarters, reaffirming the suspicions that led to **Toro's** removal as staff.

#### 6.7 My Sentiments, More DMs, and Decision to Withdraw as a Mediator

At this point, between the creation of the mediation server and the time of writing has been nothing short of stressful, overwhelming, and damaging to my own mental health. The days after this falling out, I was DMed several times about the mediation from several individuals outside of Destination Home, about the controversial Guide onboarding, and of **Toro's** removal from staff. As the secrecy and deceit affected my desire to continue being a mediator, I removed everyone from the DMZ server, blocked and removed all associated contacts, and archived it for preparation in this exposal.

At present, there are too many different things in my life, and I needed to do what I could to limit the bandwidth that this drama had on my life.
